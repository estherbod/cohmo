# This class is the global handler of both the tables and the history.
# The name of the class is inspired from the real-world name of the person
# that is in charge of organizing and overseeing all the
# coordination-related tasks.
# It is constructed directly reading information from files.
# teams_path and history_path are paths, whereas table_paths is a dictionary
# of the form: table_name: table_path.
